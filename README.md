`@bitfiber/rx` is a powerful and flexible library built on top of [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev),
tailored for managing reactive state, asynchronous dataflow, and events in modern JavaScript
applications. It introduces a structured approach to handle complex data flows through key
components such as emitters, states, groups, and stores.

This library seamlessly integrates various reactive sources like emitters, states, and observables,
enabling a cohesive and efficient dataflow. Emitters and states can be organized into groups and
stores, streamlining management and lifecycle control for related reactive components.

Whether you're working on small or large-scale applications, `@bitfiber/rx` simplifies reactive
programming, making it more efficient and maintainable.
