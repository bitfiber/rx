# @bitfiber/rx - Reactive State and Async Workflow Management Library

`@bitfiber/rx` is a powerful and flexible library built on top of [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev), tailored for managing
reactive state, asynchronous workflows, and events in modern JavaScript applications. It introduces
a structured approach to handle complex data flows through key components such as emitters, states,
groups, and stores.

This library seamlessly integrates various reactive sources like emitters, states, and observables,
enabling a cohesive and efficient workflow. Emitters and states can be organized into groups and
stores, streamlining management and lifecycle control for related reactive components.

Whether you're working on small or large-scale applications, `@bitfiber/rx` simplifies reactive
programming, making it more efficient and maintainable.

## Key Components

1. ### [Store](/store)

The Store is a foundational component for implementing reactive state management and
handling asynchronous data flow in modules or entire applications. It serves as a central hub,
organizing and managing store items like emitters, states, and groups, ensuring seamless
interaction among them.

2. ### [Emitters](/store/emitters)

Emitters are fundamental units of communication in the reactive store. They enable straightforward
creation and management of reactive streams, integrating seamlessly with other reactive sources
like emitters, states, and observables. This integration allows you to build complex networks of
streams and effectively manage reactive data flows.

3. ### [States](/store/states)

States are the core data containers in the reactive store, responsible for maintaining and
broadcasting data updates to multiple subscribers. Like emitters, states can create and manage
reactive streams to broadcast changes efficiently. They are designed to simplify state
propagation and synchronization across stores or features, ensuring consistency. States can also
integrate seamlessly with other reactive sources like emitters, states, and observables.

4. ### [Groups](/store/groups)

Groups are collections of emitters, states, and other groups that are unified under a specific
feature. They help organize related reactive sources into a cohesive structure, ensuring proper
initialization and completion of all items as a single unit.

5. ### [Data Sources](/sources)

Data sources act as facades for specific parts of data in external storages like local storage,
session storage, cookies, and more. They implement a unified interface called [DataSource](/sources/reference/dataSource),
which simplifies integration with various storage mechanisms. This interface also enables states to
seamlessly connect to external storages, ensuring that state remains synchronized with them.

## Key Features

1. **Integration with RxJS**  
Since `@bitfiber/rx` is built on top of RxJS, it integrates smoothly with the RxJS ecosystem.
Emitters and states can easily interact with observables and subjects, and can also create
effects using RxJS operators.


2. **Stream Connections**  
Easily connects multiple emitters, states, and observables to each other.


3. **Readable Code Structure**  
Produces clear, traceable code, making connections between emitters, states, and
observables easy to follow.


4. **Automatic Subscription Management**  
Simplifies handling reactive streams, freeing you from managing manual subscriptions
and completions.


5. **Synchronization with Data Sources**  
States can synchronize with data sources like local storage, cookies, and
other external data sources.


6. **Strict Typing**  
The library leverages TypeScript to enforce strict typing, ensuring robust type checking
at compile time. This reduces the likelihood of runtime errors and enhances code reliability.
TypeScript's powerful type inference also makes it easier to write cleaner, more maintainable code,
providing developers with strong guarantees about the structure and behavior of their reactive
components.


7. **Tree Shaking**  
The modular design of `@bitfiber/rx` enables tree shaking, allowing developers to optimize
bundle sizes by importing only the required functionalities. This eliminates unused code from
the final build, leading to smaller, more efficient applications, which is particularly useful
for performance-sensitive environments.
