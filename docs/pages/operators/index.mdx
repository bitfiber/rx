# What is RxJS Operators?

An Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another
Observable as output. Subscribing to the output Observable will also subscribe to the input
Observable.

Operators can be piped to Observables using the syntax observableInstance.pipe(operator) or,
more commonly, observableInstance.pipe(operatorFactory()).

## List of Operators

1. **[completeWith](/operators/reference/completeWith)**  
Completes the subscriber when the provided `trigger` observable completes

2. **[startWithDefined](/operators/reference/startWithDefined)**  
Instantly emits a value from the provided getter if the value is defined

3. **[transmit](/store/reference/transmit)**  
Transmits the result of the asynchronous action to the provided emitter or group, allowing success,
failure, and completion actions or effects to be performed. Only for [Rx Store](/store)

## Creating a Custom Operator

For creating a custom RxJS operator, you can use the **[operator](/operators/reference/operator)** method.
It provides the source observable and the subscriber as arguments in a callback function, making it
easier to define custom transformations or logic

### Custom Operator Example

```ts copy
import {Observable} from 'rxjs';
import {operator} from '@bitfiber/rx';

function customOperator<T, R>(transform: (value: T) => R) {
  return operator<T, R>((source, subscriber) => {
    return source.subscribe({
      next: value => subscriber.next(transform(value)),
      error: error => subscriber.error(error),
      complete: () => subscriber.complete(),
    });
  });
}
```
