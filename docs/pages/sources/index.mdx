# What is Data Sources?

Data sources act as facades for specific parts of data in external storages like local storage,
session storage, cookies, and more. They implement a unified interface called [DataSource](/sources/reference/dataSource),
which simplifies integration with various storage mechanisms. This interface also enables states to
seamlessly connect to external storages, ensuring that state remains synchronized with them.

Beyond providing access to a specific portion of the storage, data sources enable the ability to
subscribe to data changes. This feature ensures reactive updates within your application, keeping
your state aligned with external changes.

## List of Data Sources

1. **[Local Storage Part](/sources/reference/localStoragePartFn)**  
Provides interaction with a specific key-value pair stored in the browser's local storage

2. **[Session Storage Part](/sources/reference/sessionStoragePartFn)**  
Provides interaction with a specific key-value pair stored in the browser's session storage

3. **[Memory Storage Part](/sources/reference/memoryStoragePartFn)**  
Provides interaction with a specific key-value pair stored in the memory storage

4. **[Cookie Part](/sources/reference/cookiePartFn)**  
Provides interaction with a specific key-value pair stored in the browser's cookie

## How to Use Data Sources

### Create a data source

Letâ€™s start by creating a data source that manages data in localStorage under the key `theme`:

```ts copy
import { localStoragePart } from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Create a data source
const themeSource = localStoragePart('theme');
```

### Modify data

Use the data source to set or update the value:

```ts copy
themeSource.set('dark');
```

To remove the value, simply call:

```ts copy
themeSource.remove();
```
### Retrieve data

Retrieve the current value:

```ts copy
const value = themeSource.get();
```

### Subscribe to data changes

Data sources are reactive, meaning you can subscribe to data changes and respond accordingly:

```ts copy
themeSource.$.subscribe((theme) => {
  if (theme === 'dark') {
    // Perform logic for the dark theme
    console.log('Dark theme activated!');
  }
});
```

## Any Data Types for Storages

Data sources such as `localStoragePart`, `sessionStoragePart`, and `cookiePart` simplify
the handling of data by allowing you to store and retrieve values of any type, including objects,
arrays, and primitives. These sources automatically convert data into JSON strings when storing it
and parse JSON strings back into their original types when retrieving.

```ts copy
import {localStoragePart} from '@bitfiber/rx';

type Preferences = {theme: 'dark' | 'light'; notifications: boolean};

// Create a data source
const preferencesSource = localStoragePart<Preferences>('preferences');

// Set a preferences object in local storage
preferencesSource.set({theme: 'dark', notifications: true});

// Retrieve the preferences object from local storage
const preferences = preferencesSource.get();

// Expected result: preferences is equal to {theme: 'dark', notifications: true}
console.log(preferences);
```

## Using Data Sources with State

The [DataSource](/sources/reference/dataSource) interface facilitates seamless connection of
[state](/store/states) to specific parts of external storages, ensuring that state data remains
synchronized and up to date. This approach streamlines the management of data consistency and
alignment across your application.

### Key Benefits

* **Seamless Synchronization:**  
Automatically sync state updates to external storage and vice versa, ensuring consistent data
across your application.

* **Reactive Updates:**  
Subscribe to changes in external storages and propagate those changes directly to your state,
enabling real-time reactivity.

* **Scoped Access:**  
Focus on specific parts of storage, allowing precise and efficient management of data segments.

### State Connection Example

```ts copy
import {state, localStoragePart} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Create a state
const userPreferences = state({theme: 'dark', notifications: true}, s => s
  // Connect the state to the user preferences source
  .connect(localStoragePart('userPreferences')));

// Now, any updates to the state are saved in localStorage, and changes in
// localStorage will automatically update the state
```

## Creating a Custom Data Source

To create a custom data source, you need to implement the [DataSource](/sources/reference/dataSource)
interface. This allows your custom data source to integrate seamlessly with [states](/store/states)

### Custom Data Source Example

```ts copy
import {Subject} from 'rxjs';
import {DataSource} from '@bitfiber/rx';

class CustomDataSource<T = any> implements DataSource<T> {
  private value: T;
  private readonly subject = new Subject<T>();

  // Observable stream for external subscribers
  readonly $ = this.subject.asObservable();

  // Retrieve the current value
  get(): T {
    return this.value;
  }

  // Update the value and notify subscribers
  set(value: T): void {
    this.value = value;
    this.subject.next(this.value);
  }

  // Remove the value and notify subscribers
  remove(): void {
    delete this.value;
    this.subject.next(undefined);
  }
}
```
