# What is Key-Value Sources?

Key-value sources act as facades for external storages like local storage, session storage,
cookies, and more. They implement a unified interface called [KeyValueSource](/sources/reference/keyValueSource),
which simplifies integration with various storage mechanisms.

In addition to storage access, key-value sources provide the ability to subscribe to data changes
in external storages, enabling reactive updates within your application.

## List of Key-Value Sources

1. **[Local Storage](/sources/reference/localStorageFn)**  
Provides interaction with the browser's local storage

2. **[Session Storage](/sources/reference/sessionStorageFn)**  
Provides interaction with the browser's session storage

3. **[Memory Storage](/sources/reference/memoryStorageFn)**  
Provides interaction the memory storage

4. **[Cookie](/sources/reference/cookieFn)**  
Provides interaction with the browser's cookie

## How to Use Key-Value Sources

### Create a key-value source

Letâ€™s start by creating a key-value source that manages data in localStorage:

```ts copy
import { localStorage } from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Create a key-value source
const lsSource = localStorage();
```

### Modify data

Set or update the value for a specific key:

```ts copy
lsSource.set('theme', 'dark');
```

To remove the value for a key, use:

```ts copy
lsSource.remove('theme');
```

### Retrieve data

Retrieve the current value for a key:

```ts copy
const value = lsSource.get('theme');
```

### Subscribe to data changes

Key-value sources are reactive, meaning you can subscribe to changes for a specific key and
respond accordingly:

```ts copy
lsSource.observe('theme').subscribe((theme) => {
  if (theme === 'dark') {
    // Perform logic for the dark theme
    console.log('Dark theme activated!');
  }
});
```

## Any Data Types for Storages

Key-value sources such as `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `cookie` simplify the handling of
data by allowing you to store and retrieve values of any type, including objects, arrays, and
primitives. These sources automatically convert data into JSON strings when storing it and parse
JSON strings back into their original types when retrieving.

```ts copy
import {localStorage} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Create a key-value source
const lsSource = localStorage();

// Set a preferences object in local storage
lsSource.set('preferences', {theme: 'dark', notifications: true});

// Retrieve the preferences object from local storage
const preferences = lsSource.get('preferences');

// Expected result: preferences is equal to {theme: 'dark', notifications: true}
console.log(preferences);
```
