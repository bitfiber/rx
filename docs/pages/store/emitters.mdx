# Emitters

Emitters are fundamental units of communication in the reactive store. They enable straightforward
creation and management of reactive streams, integrating seamlessly with other reactive sources
like emitters, states, and observables. This integration allows you to build complex networks of
streams and effectively manage reactive data flows.

## Creating an Emitter

### Basic Emitter

To create [Emitter](/store/reference/emitter), use the [emitter](/store/reference/emitterFn) function:

```ts copy
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const counter = emitter<number>();
```
### Emitter with Interaction Logic

To add interaction logic with other reactive sources, use the `onInit` callback. This ensures
subscriptions and emissions occur only after the store is initialized:

```ts copy
const receiver = emitter<number>(e => e
  // Add interaction logic here
  .receive(source));

const source = emitter<number>();
```

## Emitting Data

Emitters allow you to send data to their subscribers, effects, and any connected reactive sources
using the [emit](/store/reference/emitter/emit) method:

```ts copy
const token = emitter<string>();

token.emit('token');
```

## Receiving Data

Emitters can receive data from various reactive sources like emitters, states, and observables,
transmitting it to subscribers without storing the data.

### Methods for Receiving Data

1. **[receive](/store/reference/emitter/receive) method**

Emitters can receive data from other reactive sources using the `receive` method.

**Without Data Transformation**

```ts copy
import {of} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source1 = emitter<number>();
const source2 = state<number>(1);
const source3$ = of(1);

const receiver = emitter<number>(e => e
  .receive(source1, source2, source3$));
```

**With Data Transformation**

```ts copy
const receiver = emitter<string>(e => e
  .receive(source1, value => String(value)));
```

2. **[select](/store/reference/emitter/select) method**

Combines data from all sources and emits a computed value whenever any source emits:

```ts copy
const receiver = emitter<number>(e => e
  .select(source1, source2, source3$, (v1, v2, v3) => v1 * v2 * v3));
```

3. **[zip](/store/reference/emitter/zip) method**

Combines data from all sources, emitting only when all sources emit new values:

```ts copy
const receiver = emitter<number>(e => e
  .zip(source1, source2, source3$, (v1, v2, v3) => v1 * v2 * v3));
```

4. **[wait](/store/reference/emitter/wait) method**

Waits for the first values from all sources, emits a computed value, and completes the stream:

```ts copy
const receiver = emitter<number>(e => e
  .wait(source1, source2, source3$, (v1, v2, v3) => v1 * v2 * v3));
```
## Working with Observables

Emitters can receive data from observables, which allows you to use RxJS operators for more
advanced stream manipulation before connecting them to emitters.

```ts copy
import {debounceTime, filter} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source = emitter<number>();

// The '$' property returns the emitter observable
const source$ = source.$.pipe(
  filter(v => v % 2),
  debounceTime(500),
);

const receiver = emitter<number>(e => e
  .receive(source$));
```

## Transmitting Data

Emitters can transmit their emitted values to other reactive sources using
the [transmit](/store/reference/emitter/transmit) method.

### Without Data Transformation

```ts copy
import {Subject} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source = emitter<number>(e => e
  .transmit(receiver1, receiver2, receiver3));

const receiver1 = emitter<number>();
const receiver2 = state<number>(0);
const receiver3 = new Subject<number>();
```

### With Data Transformation

```ts copy
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source = emitter<string>(e => e
  .transmit(receiver, (value, state) => state + Number(value)));

const receiver = state<number>(0);
```

## Creating Side Effects

Emitters support creating side effects using [tap](/store/reference/emitter/tap) and
[effect](/store/reference/emitter/effect) methods.

### Using Tap

The `tap` method performs a side effect whenever the emitter emits a value.

```ts copy
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const logger = emitter<number>(e => e
  .tap(data => console.log(data)));
```

### Using Effect

The `effect` method allows for complex stream management using RxJS operators.

```ts copy
import {debounceTime, filter, switchMap} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const productReq = emitter<number | null>(e => e
  .effect(
    filter(id => id !== null),
    debounceTime(1000),
    switchMap(id => productsService.get(`api/product${id}`)),
  ));
```

## Managing All Streams

Emitters allow you to apply RxJS operators across all their streams simultaneously using
the [manage](/store/reference/state/manage) method. This ensures consistent stream behavior
by applying the same operators to all streams generated by the emitter.

```ts copy
import {delay, filter} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Create an emitter with managed streams
const id = emitter<number>(e => e
  // Apply operators to all streams of this emitter
  .manage(
    // Filter values to pass only odd numbers
    filter(id => !!(id % 2)),
    // Add a delay to all emissions
    delay(100),
  ));
```
