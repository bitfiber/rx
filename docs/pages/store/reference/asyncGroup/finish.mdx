# finish <Badge type={'property'}>Property</Badge> <Badge type={'modifier'}>Readonly</Badge>

An emitter that triggers when the asynchronous action's entire lifecycle is completed,
whether it ends in success or failure. This emitter does not carry any payload (`void`),
as it simply serves as a notification that the process is fully complete

## API

```ts copy
readonly finish: Emitter<void>;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {switchMap} from 'rxjs';
import {asyncGroup, transmit} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Creates an asynchronous group
const group = asyncGroup<number, string[], Error>((group, {launch, finish}) => {
  launch
    // Sets an effect to be triggered on new launch emissions
    .effect(
      switchMap(page => apiService.get(`api/get?page=${page}`)
        // 'transmit' operator takes either data or an error and transmits it to the `success`
        // or `fail` emitter of the group, respectively
        .pipe(transmit(group))),
    );

  finish
    // Performs a tap callback each time the request either fails or succeeds
    .tap(() => console.log('Request has been finished'));
});
```
