import {Badge} from '../../../../';

# complete <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Completes the emitter, signaling to all subscribers that no more values will be emitted.

Once the emitter is completed, it will not emit any further values, and any subsequent subscriptions
will immediately receive an error.

In most cases, this method will be called automatically by a group or store managing the emitter,
so you generally don't need to call it manually unless you have a specific reason to do so

## API

```ts copy
complete(): void;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const num = emitter<number>();

// Completes the emitter
num.complete();
```
