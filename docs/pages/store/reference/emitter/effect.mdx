# effect <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Creates a new stream with a side effect, similar to the RxJS `pipe` method.

This method allows you to apply a sequence of RxJS operators to the emitter's stream,
performing actions or side effects whenever the emitter emits a value. This can be
particularly useful for tasks like logging, debugging, or triggering external operations
in response to emitted values

`@param ...operators: OperatorFunction<any, any>[] {:ts}`  
A sequence of RxJS operators that define the side effects to be applied to the emitted values

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the emitter, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
effect(...operators: OperatorFunction<any, any>[]): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {debounceTime, filter, switchMap} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const productReq = emitter<number | null>(e => e
  // Performs an effect each time the emitter emits new value
  .effect(
    filter(id => id !== null),
    debounceTime(1000),
    switchMap(id => productsService.get(`api/product${id}`)),
  ));
```
