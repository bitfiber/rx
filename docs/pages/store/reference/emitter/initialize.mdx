import {Badge} from '../../../../';

# initialize <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Initiates the emitter.  
In most cases, this method will be called automatically by a group or store managing the emitter,
so you generally don't need to call it manually unless you have a specific reason to do so

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the emitter, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
initialize(): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const num = emitter<number>();

// Initialize the emitter
num.initialize();
```
