# manage <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Defines management operators for all emitter streams.
These operators are applied to the streams managed by this emitter,
allowing you to modify or control their behavior, such as filtering,
mapping, or handling errors, without altering the type of the emitted values

`@param ...operators: OperatorFunction<T, T>[] {:ts}`   
One or more RxJS operators to apply to the emitter streams

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the emitter, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
manage(...operators: OperatorFunction<T, T>[]): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {delay, filter} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const launch = emitter<number>(e => e
  // All streams created by this emitter will delay and filter the data
  .manage(
    filter(id => !!(id % 2)),
    delay(100),
  ));
```
