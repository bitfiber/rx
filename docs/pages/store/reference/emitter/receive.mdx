# receive <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

## Overload 1

Receives values from one or more emitters, states, or observables
and emits them to all subscribers of this emitter.

This method allows this emitter to listen to external sources and relay their
emitted values to its own subscribers, effectively linking multiple data streams together

`@param ...inputs: EmitterOrObservable<T>[] {:ts}`  
One or more emitters, states, or observables that provide values to be emitted by this emitter

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the emitter, allowing for method chaining

### API

```ts copy
receive(...inputs: EmitterOrObservable<T>[]): this;
```

### Example

```ts copy
import {of} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source1 = emitter<number>();
const source2 = state<number>(1);
const source3$ = of(1);

const result = emitter<number>(e => e
  // Receives data from each reactive source separately and emits a value to its subscribers
  // immediately, without waiting for other sources to emit
  .receive(source1, source2, source3$));
```
## Overload 2

Receives a value from an emitter, state, or observable, applies a reducer function to convert
this value to the emitter's type, and emits the result to all subscribers of this emitter.

This method allows this emitter to listen to external source and relay the transformed
emitted value to its own subscribers, effectively linking data streams together

`@param input: EmitterOrObservable<I> {:ts}`  
An emitter, state or observable that provide values to be emitted by this emitter

`@param reducer: (value: I) => T {:ts}`  
A function that converts the received value from its original type to the type expected by this
emitter, allowing for customization of the emitted value

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the emitter, allowing for method chaining

### API

```ts copy
receive<I>(input: EmitterOrObservable<I>, reducer: (value: I, state: T) => T): this;
```

### Example

```ts copy
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source = state<number>(1);

const result = emitter<string>(e => e
  // Receives data from a reactive source, converts the value, and emits the result to its subscribers
  .receive(source, value => String(value)));
```
