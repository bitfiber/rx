# transmit <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

## Overload 1

Transmits values from the current emitter to one or more other emitters, states, or subjects.
It enables the propagation of data or events across multiple sources, effectively creating
a network of interconnected reactive sources

`@param ...outputs: (EmitterOrSubject<T> | EmitterOrSubject<void>)[] {:ts}`  
One or more emitters, states, or subjects that will receive the transmitted values from this emitter

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the emitter, allowing for method chaining

### API

```ts copy
transmit(...outputs: (EmitterOrSubject<T> | EmitterOrSubject<void>)[]): this;
```

### Example

```ts copy
import {Subject} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const receiver1 = emitter<number>();
const receiver2 = state<number>(0);
const receiver3 = new Subject<number>();

const source = emitter<number>(e => e
  // Transmits every emitted value to all reactive sources for further processing or handling
  .transmit(receiver1, receiver2, receiver3));
```

## Overload 2

Transmits values from the current emitter to a state. By using a reducer function,
the emitted values can be transformed or customized to match the expected format of the state

`@param output: AbstractState<O> {:ts}`  
A state that will receive the transmitted values from this emitter

`@param reducer: (value: T, state: O) => O {:ts}`  
A function that converts or transforms the emitted value from this emitter type to the type expected
by the state

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the emitter, allowing for method chaining

### API

```ts copy
transmit<O>(output: AbstractState<O>, reducer: (value: T, state: O) => O): this;
```

### Example

```ts copy
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const receiver = state<number>(0);

const source = emitter<string>(e => e
  // Transmits every emitted value to the state for further processing or handling.
  // By using a reducer function, the emitted values can be transformed to match the expected
  // format of the state
  .transmit(receiver, (value, state) => state + Number(value)));
```

## Overload 3

Transmits values from the current emitter to another emitter or subject.
By using a reducer function, the emitted values can be transformed or customized to match
the expected format of the target emitter or subject

`@param output: EmitterOrSubject<O> {:ts}`  
An emitter or subject that will receive the transmitted values from this emitter

`@param reducer: (value: T) => O {:ts}`  
A function that converts or transforms the emitted value from the current emitter's type to the type
expected by the receiving emitter or subject

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the emitter, allowing for method chaining

### API

```ts copy
transmit<O>(output: EmitterOrSubject<O>, reducer: (value: T) => O): this;
```

### Example

```ts copy
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const receiver = emitter<number>();

const source = emitter<string>(e => e
  // Transmits every emitted value to another emitter for further processing or handling.
  // By using a reducer function, the emitted values can be transformed to match the expected
  // format of the receiving emitter
  .transmit(receiver, value => Number(value)));
```
