# Group <Badge type={'class'}>Class</Badge>

Represents a group that collects all subsequently created group items such as emitters, states,
and groups until `group.markAsReady()` is called

## API

```ts copy
class Group extends AbstractGroup {
  initialize(): this;
  complete(): void;
  markAsReady(): void;
}
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {state, emitter, group, asyncGroup} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Collects all subsequently created emitters, states, and groups for
// mass initialization and completion
const someGroup = group();

// The emitter, state, and group will be added in 'someGroup'
const someState = state<string>('initialValue1');
const someEmitter = emitter<number>();
const reqGroup = asyncGroup<string, number, number>();

// Marks the group as ready, indicating that all group items, such as emitters, states,
// and groups, have been defined
someGroup.markAsReady();

// Initializes the group and all items within the group
someGroup.initialize();

// Completes the group and all items within the group
someGroup.complete();
```
