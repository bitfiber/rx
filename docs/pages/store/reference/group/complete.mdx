import {Badge} from '../../../../';

# complete <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Completes the group and all its items, signaling to all item subscribers that no more values
will be emitted.

Once the group is completed, Its items will no longer emit any values, and any subsequent
subscriptions will immediately receive an error.

In most cases, this method will be called automatically by a group or store managing the group,
so you generally don't need to call it manually unless you have a specific reason to do so

## API

```ts copy
complete(): void;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {group} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const someGroup = group();

// Completes the group and all items within the group
group.complete();
```
