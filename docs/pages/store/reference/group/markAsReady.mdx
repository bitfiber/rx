# markAsReady <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Marks the group as ready, indicating that all group items, such as emitters, states, and groups,
have been defined.  
This method must be called after all group items are defined!

## API

```ts copy
markAsReady(): void;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {state, group} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Collects all subsequently created emitters, states, and groups for
// mass initialization and completion
const someGroup = group();

// The state will be added in 'someGroup'
const someState = state<string>('initialValue1');

// Marks the store as ready, indicating that all store items, such as emitters, states,
// and groups, have been defined
someGroup.markAsReady();
```
