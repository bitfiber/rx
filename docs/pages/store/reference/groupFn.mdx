const someState = state<string>('');
const someEmitter = emitter<number>();
const req = asyncGroup<string, number, number>();

// Marks the group as ready, indicating that all group items, such as emitters, states,
// and groups, have been defined
myGroup.markAsReady();

// Initializes the group and all items within the group
myGroup.initialize();
