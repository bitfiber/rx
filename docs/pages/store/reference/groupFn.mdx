items such as emitters, states, and groups until `group.markAsReady()` is called

`@returns Group {:ts}`

## API

```ts copy
function group(): Group;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {state, emitter, group, asyncGroup} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Defines a group that will collect all subsequently created emitters, states, and groups
const myGroup = group();

// Add group items here
const someState = state<string>('');
const someEmitter = emitter<number>();
const req = asyncGroup<string, number, number>();

// Marks the group as ready, indicating that all group items have been defined
myGroup.markAsReady();

// Initializes the group and all items within the group
myGroup.initialize();

// Completes the group and all items within the group
myGroup.complete();
```
