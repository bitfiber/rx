import {Badge} from '../../../../';

# initialize <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Initiates the group and all its items.

In most cases, this method will be called automatically by a group or store managing
the group, so you generally don't need to call it manually unless you have a specific
reason to do so

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the group, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
initialize(): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {state, emitter, namedGroup} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const group = namedGroup({launch: emitter<void>(), data: state<number>(0)});

// Initializes the group and all items within the group
group.initialize();
```
