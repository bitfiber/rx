import {Badge} from '../../../../';

# complete <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Completes the state, signaling to all subscribers that no more values will be emitted.

Once the state is completed, it will not emit any further values, and any subsequent subscriptions
will immediately receive an error.

In most cases, this method will be called automatically by a group or store managing the state,
so you generally don't need to call it manually unless you have a specific reason to do so

## API

```ts copy
complete(): void;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const data = state<number>(10);

// Completes the state
data.complete();
```
