# effect <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Creates a new stream with a side effect, similar to the RxJS `pipe` method.

This method allows you to apply a sequence of RxJS operators to the state's stream,
performing actions or side effects whenever the state emits a value. This can be
particularly useful for tasks like logging, debugging, or triggering external operations
in response to emitted values

`@param ...operators: OperatorFunction<any, any>[] {:ts}`  
A sequence of RxJS operators that define the side effects to be applied to the emitted values

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the current state, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
effect(...operators: OperatorFunction<any, any>[]): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {switchMap, of} from 'rxjs';
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const openDialog = state<boolean>(false, s => s
  // Performs an effect each time the emitter emits new value
  .effect(
    switchMap(isOpened => !isOpened ? dialog.open() : of(false)),
  ));
```
