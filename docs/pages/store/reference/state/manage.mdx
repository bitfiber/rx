# manage <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Defines management operators for all state streams. These operators are applied to the streams
managed by this state, allowing you to modify or control their behavior, such as filtering,
mapping, or handling errors, without altering the type of the emitted values

`@param ...operators: OperatorFunction<T, T>[] {:ts}`   
One or more RxJS operators to apply to the state streams

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the current state, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
manage(...operators: OperatorFunction<T, T>[]): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {delay, filter} from 'rxjs';
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const data = state<number>(0, s => s
  // All streams created by this state will delay and filter the data
  .manage(
    filter(id => !!(id % 2)),
    delay(100),
  ));
```
