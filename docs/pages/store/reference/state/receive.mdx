# receive <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

## Overload 1

Receives values from one or more emitters, states, or observables
and emits them to all subscribers of this state.

This method allows this state to listen to external sources and relay their
emitted values to its own subscribers, effectively linking multiple data streams together

`@param ...inputs: EmitterOrObservable<T>[] {:ts}`  
One or more emitters, states, or observables that provide values to be emitted by this state

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the current state, allowing for method chaining

### API

```ts copy
receive(...inputs: EmitterOrObservable<T>[]): this;
```

### Example

```ts copy
import {of} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source1 = emitter<number>();
const source2 = state<number>(1);
const source3$ = of(1);

const result = state<number>(0, s => s
  // Receives data from each reactive source separately and emits a value to its subscribers
  // immediately, without waiting for other sources to emit
  .receive(source1, source2, source3$));
```
## Overload 2

Receives a value from an emitter, state, or observable, applies a reducer function to convert
this value to the state's type, and emits the result to all subscribers of this state.

This method allows this state to listen to external source and relay the transformed
emitted value to its own subscribers, effectively linking data streams together

`@param input: EmitterOrObservable<I> {:ts}`  
An emitter, state or observable that provide values to be emitted by this state

`@param reducer: (value: I, state: T) => T {:ts}`  
A function that converts or transforms the received value from the input type to the type expected
by this state. This function takes the value emitted by the input and this state value as
parameters, and returns the new state value

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the current state, allowing for method chaining

### API

```ts copy
receive<I>(input: EmitterOrObservable<I>, reducer: (value: I, state: T) => T): this;
```

### Example

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source = state<number>(1);

const result = state<string>('', s => s
  // Receives data from a reactive source, converts the value, and emits the result to its subscribers
  .receive(source, value => String(value)));
```
