import {Badge} from '../../../../';

# set <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Updates the state to the provided `value` immediately, but the emission of this
new value to subscribers will be performed asynchronously. This means that if multiple
synchronous updates are made in quick succession, only the last update will be emitted,
optimizing the emission process to prevent unnecessary updates

`@param value: T {:ts}`  
The new value to set as the current state

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the current state, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
set(value: T): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const data = state<number>(0);

// Sets a new state value and emits the updated state to its subscribers
data.set(7);
```
