# useLazyEmission <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Enables lazy emission for the state, meaning that the state will defer emitting its initial value
to subscribers until an explicit trigger occurs. This can be useful in scenarios where you want
more control over when the state emits its value, rather than emitting immediately

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the current state, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
useLazyEmission(): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const data = state<number>(0, s => s
  // Forces the state not to emit a value at the time of subscription
  .useLazyEmission());
```
