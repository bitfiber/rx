# useLazyEmissionOnce <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Enables one-time lazy emission for the next created stream.

Once the `useLazyEmissionOnce` method is called, the state will defer emitting its initial value
until an explicit trigger occurs. This lazy emission behavior will apply only once for the next
stream that is created. After this initial deferred emission, subsequent streams will emit values
immediately as changes occur.

This method can be called multiple times before creating streams, allowing you to control
when the lazy emission behavior is applied.

By default, one-time lazy emission is disabled, meaning that streams will emit their initial
values immediately upon creation unless this behavior is explicitly overridden

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the current state, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
useLazyEmissionOnce(): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const data = state<number>(0, s => s
  // Forces the next stream not to emit a value at the time of subscription
  .useLazyEmissionOnce()
  // Will not emit a value at the time of subscription
  .effect()
  // Will emit a value at the time of subscription
  .transmit());
```
