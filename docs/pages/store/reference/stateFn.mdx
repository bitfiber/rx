# state <Badge type={'function'}>Function</Badge>

Creates an instance that combines the functionality of both the `State` class and the `StateGetter`
function, initialized with the provided `initialValue`.

Optionally, you can provide an `onInit` callback function, which is called just before
the initialization process, allowing you to perform setup tasks or configure the state before
it starts emitting values

`@template T {:ts}`  
The type of the state value

`@param initialValue: T {:ts}`  
The initial value of the state

`@param onInit?: (state: StateType<T>) => void {:ts}`  
An optional callback function that is executed just before the initialization of the state,
allowing you to perform setup tasks or configure the state before it starts emitting values

`@returns StateType<T> {:ts}`  
A new `State` instance that also acts as the `StateGetter` function to get the current state value

## API

```ts copy
function state<T>(initialValue: T, onInit?: (state: StateType<T>) => void): StateType<T>;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {take, filter, switchMap} from 'rxjs';
import {state, namedGroup} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Creates a state that stores and emits the IDs
const currentId = state<number>(1, s => s
  // Uses a custom function for comparing values. By default, the 'equals' function is used
  .compareBy((a, b) => a === b)
  // Transmits all emitted data to the 'productReq' emitter
  .transmit(productReq));

// The observable of the state
const currentId$ = currentId.$;

// Creates a state that stores and emits the final ID
const lastId = state<number | null>(null, s => s
  // Uses '===' for comparing values. By default, the 'equals' function is used
  .compareBy('strict')
  // Forces the state not to emit a value at the time of subscription
  .useLazyEmission());

// Creates a state that receives transmitted 'currentId' data and performs an effect that calls an API
const productReq = state<number>(0, s => s
  // All streams created by this state will filter the data
  .manage(
    filter(id => !!(id % 2)),
  )
  // Performs a tap callback each time the state emits new filtered data
  .tap(id => {
    console.log(id);
  })
  // Performs a effect each time the state emits new filtered data
  .effect(
    switchMap(id => productsService.get(`api/product${id}`)),
  ));

// Creates a state that receives used IDs and logs them through an effect
const log = state<string>(0, s => s
  // Runs an effect when data is received from the `currentId` state
  .receive(currentId, id => `A new id ${id} was received`)
  // Runs an effect when data is received from the `lastId` state
  .receive(lastId, id => `the last id ${id} was received`)
  // Performs an effect each time the state emits newly received logged data
  .effect(
    switchMap(log => logService.post(`api/log`, {log})),
  ));

// Creates a state that performs a tap callback each time data is selected
const result1 = state<[number, number]>([0, 0], s => s
  // Runs a tap callback when all data is selected from the `currentId` and `lastId` states
  .select(currentId$, lastId, (currentId, lastId) => [currentId, lastId])
  // Performs a tap callback each time the state emits new data
  .tap(range => {
    console.log(range);
  }));

// Creates a state that performs a tap callback each time data is selected
const result2 = state<[number, number]>([0, 0], s => s
  // Runs a tap callback when all data is selected from the `currentId` and `lastId` states
  .zip(currentId$, lastId, (currentId, lastId) => [currentId, lastId])
  // Performs a tap callback each time the state emits new data
  .tap(range => {
    console.log(range);
  }));

// Creates a state that records the timestamp of the last received ID
const lastIdTime = state<number | null>(null, s => s
  // Waits for the first value from the `lastId` state, then completes the stream
  .wait(lastId, lastId => new Date().getTime()));

// Groups all emitters and states for mass initialization and completion
const group = namedGroup({currentId, lastId, productReq, log, result1, result2});

// Initializes the group and all items within the group
group.initialize();

// Subscribes to the observable of the state
currentId$
  .pipe(take(1))
  .subscribe(id => console.log(id));

// Sets the state value and emits the new value to subscribers
currentId.set(2);

// Updates the state value and emits the new value to subscribers
currentId.update(state => state + 1);

// Accesses the 'lastId' state through the group and sets data
group.lastId.set(4);

// Gets the current state value in two ways
const id1 = currentId();
const id2 = currentId.get();

// Completes the group and all items within the group
group.complete();
```
