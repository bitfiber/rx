no further changes or updates will be made to it or its items.
This method is called automatically when the associated component or service is destroyed

## API

import {state, Store} from '@bitfiber/rx';

class ProductsStore extends Store {
  products = state<any[]>();
  #ready = this.markAsReady();
}

// Completes the store
store.complete();
```
