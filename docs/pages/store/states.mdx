# States

States are the core data containers in the reactive store, responsible for maintaining and
broadcasting data updates to multiple subscribers. Like emitters, states can create and manage
reactive streams to broadcast changes efficiently. They are designed to simplify state
propagation and synchronization across stores or features, ensuring consistency. States can also
integrate seamlessly with other reactive sources like emitters, states, and observables.

## Creating a State

### Basic State

To create [State](/store/reference/state), use the [state](/store/reference/stateFn) function:

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const counter = state<number>(0);
```
### State with Interaction Logic

To add interaction logic with other reactive sources, use the `onInit` callback. This ensures
subscriptions and emissions occur only after the store is initialized:

```ts copy
const receiver = state<number>(0, s => s
  // Add interaction logic here
  .receive(source));

const source = emitter<number>();
```

## Getting Current Data

States allow you to get current data using [get](/store/reference/state/get) method or calling
the state like a function:

```ts copy
const counter = state<number>(1);

const value1 = counter(); // Expected result: 1
const value2 = counter.get(); // Expected result: 1
```

## Updating State

States allow you to update their data and send updated data to their subscribers, effects, and any
connected reactive sources using [set](/store/reference/state/set) and
[update](/store/reference/state/update) methods.

The `set` method directly sets a new value:

```ts copy
const counter = state<number>(0);

counter.set(5);
```

The `update` method computes a new value based on the current value:

```ts copy
const counter = state<number>(0);

counter.update(state => state + 1);
```

## Resetting State

You can reset the state to its initial value using the [reset](/store/reference/state/reset) method:

```ts copy
const counter = state<number>(1);

counter.reset();
```

## Receiving Data

States can receive data from various reactive sources like emitters, states, and observables,
updating their data and transmitting it to subscribers.

### Methods for Receiving Data

1. **[receive](/store/reference/state/receive) method**

States can receive data from other reactive sources using the `receive` method.

**Without Data Transformation**

```ts copy
import {of} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source1 = emitter<number>();
const source2 = state<number>(1);
const source3$ = of(1);

const receiver = state<number>(0, s => s
  .receive(source1, source2, source3$));
```

**With Data Transformation**

```ts copy
const receiver = state<string>('', s => s
  .receive(source1, value => String(value)));
```

2. **[select](/store/reference/state/select) method**

Combines data from all sources, updates its data by a computed value, and emits a computed value
whenever any source emits:

```ts copy
const receiver = state<number>(0, s => s
  .select(source1, source2, source3$, (v1, v2, v3) => v1 * v2 * v3));
```

3. **[zip](/store/reference/state/zip) method**

Combines data from all sources, updating its data by a computed value and emitting a computed value
only when all sources emit new values:

```ts copy
const receiver = state<number>(0, s => s
  .zip(source1, source2, source3$, (v1, v2, v3) => v1 * v2 * v3));
```

4. **[wait](/store/reference/state/wait) method**

Waits for the first values from all sources, updates its data by a computed value, emits
a computed value, and completes the stream:

```ts copy
const receiver = state<number>(0, s => s
  .wait(source1, source2, source3$, (v1, v2, v3) => v1 * v2 * v3));
```
## Working with Observables

States can receive data from observables, which allows you to use RxJS operators for more
advanced stream manipulation before connecting them to states.

```ts copy
import {debounceTime, filter} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source = emitter<number>();

// The '$' property returns the emitter observable
const source$ = source.$.pipe(
  filter(v => v % 2),
  debounceTime(500),
);

const receiver = state<number>(0, s => s
  .receive(source$));
```

## Transmitting Data

States can transmit their updated data to other reactive sources using
the [transmit](/store/reference/state/transmit) method.

### Without Data Transformation

```ts copy
import {Subject} from 'rxjs';
import {emitter, state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source = state<number>(0, s => s
  .transmit(receiver1, receiver2, receiver3));

const receiver1 = emitter<number>();
const receiver2 = state<number>(0);
const receiver3 = new Subject<number>();
```

### With Data Transformation

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const source = state<string>(0, s => s
  .transmit(receiver, (value, state) => state + Number(value)));

const receiver = state<number>(0);
```

## Creating Side Effects

States support creating side effects using [tap](/store/reference/state/tap) and
[effect](/store/reference/state/effect) methods.

### Using Tap

The `tap` method performs a side effect whenever the state emits a value.

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const logger = state<number>(0, s => s
  .tap(data => console.log(data)));
```

### Using Effect

The `effect` method allows for complex stream management using RxJS operators.

```ts copy
import {debounceTime, filter} from 'rxjs';
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const itemId = state<number | null>(null, s => s
  .effect(
    filter(id => id !== null),
    debounceTime(1000),
  ));
```

## Comparison Type

States evaluate changes using a specific [Comparison](/store/reference/comparison) type.
By default, states use the `equals` comparison type, which ensures data is updated only when
values are different based on deep equality checks.

You can change the comparison type for a specific state using
the [compareBy](/store/reference/state/compareBy) method:

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const data1 = state<number>(10, s => s
  // Uses '===' for comparing values
  .compareBy('strict'));

const data2 = state<number | string>(10, s => s
  // Uses a custom function for comparing values
  .compareBy((a, b) => Number(a) === Number(b)));
```

To globally change the default comparison type for all states in your application, use
the [changeDefaultComparison](/store/reference/changeDefaultComparison) function:

```ts copy
import {changeDefaultComparison} from '@bitfiber/rx';

changeDefaultComparison('strict');
```

## Lazy Emission

In scenarios where immediate emission is not desirable at the time of subscription, use
the [useLazyEmission](/store/reference/state/useLazyEmission) or
[useLazyEmissionOnce](/store/reference/state/useLazyEmissionOnce) methods.

### For All Subscriptions

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const data = state<number>(0, s => s
  .useLazyEmission());
```

### For the Next Subscription

```ts copy
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const data = state<number>(0, s => s
  .useLazyEmissionOnce()
  // Will not emit a value at the time of subscription
  .effect(...)
  // Will emit a value at the time of subscription
  .transmit(...));
```

## Synchronizing with Data Sources

State can be synchronized with external [data sources](/sources/) that implement
the [DataSource](/sources/reference/dataSource/) interface like
[localStoragePart](/sources/reference/localStoragePart/). For this, use
the [connect](/store/reference/state/connect) method.

Once connected, the state automatically updates from the data source whenever the source changes,
and conversely, updates the data source whenever the state value is changed. This bidirectional
synchronization ensures that both the state and the data source remain in sync.

```ts copy
import {state, localStoragePart} from '@bitfiber/rx';

const theme = state<'dark' | 'light'>('dark', s => s
  .connect(localStoragePart('theme')));
```

## Managing All Streams

States allow you to apply RxJS operators across all their streams simultaneously using
the [manage](/store/reference/state/manage) method. This ensures consistent stream behavior
by applying the same operators to all streams generated by the state.

```ts copy
import {delay, filter} from 'rxjs';
import {state} from '@bitfiber/rx';

// Create a state with managed streams
const data = state<number>(0, s => s
  // Apply operators to all streams of this state
  .manage(
    // Filter values to pass only odd numbers
    filter(id => !!(id % 2)),
    // Add a delay to all emissions
    delay(100),
  ));
```
